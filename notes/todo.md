# To Do

## DONE - Collect the data into a tables/dataframe

## Add food pairing

## Get all professional reviews and ratings if there are multiple, instead of just the first

## Get user ratings if available

## Automatically scrape site
### Known bugs: Paragraph'd tasting notes

## Take reviews and count number of occurances of certain words, maybe group collections of
similar meaning words (ex: floral & flowers). Take top 100(?) groups and add them as a descriptive attribute

## Catch tasting notes or reviews with words from this site: https://wine.lovetoknow.com/wine-beginners/wine-characteristics-glossary

## Region-Country pairing seems off in later entries. Check and clean for data accuracy

## Some varieties have extra characters. Clean entries.
